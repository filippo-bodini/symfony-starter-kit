# Sparkfabrik - Simple Symfony starter kit

This a starter-kit is freely provided by Sparkfabrik.  
It was intended to be used as a sandbox for technical challenges but it can also come in handy to kickstart simple Symfony-based PHP projects with no effort.

## Usage

You can start the project by running `make`. This will build and run a barebone Symfony application and a MySQL database.

Visit `http://localhost:8000` from your local web browser to see your application.  
If you don't see anything right away, just wait up to one minute, since it usually takes a bit for the integrated webserver to start.

You can anyway follow the log with `docker-compose logs -f app`.
